### acp - Add, Commit, Push
Quick shorthand for the common git workflow:
- `acp` = Add all changes, commit, and push to origin

**Usage:**
When you want to add, commit, and push changes, simply say:
- "acp"
- "acp with message <your message>"

This will execute:
1. `git add -A`
2. `git commit -m "<message>"`
3. `git push origin master`
